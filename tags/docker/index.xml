At first glance there isn&amp;rsquo;t much of a difference between the two, both show a GNOME desktop environment that&amp;rsquo;s almost identical. The main difference is that Fedora Silverblue is a variant of Fedora that uses an immutable base system.
The TL;DR for Silverblue is that you can&amp;rsquo;t install packages as you would in Workstation.</description></item></channel></rss>
